## EFA vs CFA

**EFA** and **CFA** are mathematically and conceptually different. 

EFA:

* Estimates all possible variable/factor relationships
* Looking for patterns in the data
* Use when you don't have a well-developed theory

CFA:

* Only specified variable/factor relationships
* Testing a theory that you know in advance
* Report when publishing a new measure / scale
